      "faqAnswer2": "We accept PDF documents, JPG images, and PNG images up to 10MB in size. You can even take a photo of a printed contract with your phone and upload it.",
      "faqAnswer3": "No! You can try ContractGuard for free without creating an account. However, creating a free account lets you save your analyses, access them anytime, and get additional features.",
      "faqAnswer4": "Most contracts are analyzed in 60 seconds or less. Complex or very long contracts may take up to 2 minutes. You'll see a progress bar while your contract is being processed.",
      "faqAnswer5": "Every analysis includes: an overall security score, risk level assessment, red flag detection, cost breakdown, market comparison, and actionable recommendations for negotiation.",
      "faqAnswer6": "Our analysis identifies common contract issues and problematic clauses. While we strive for accuracy and continuously improve our system, we recommend professional legal review for high-stakes contracts or complex situations.",
      "faqAnswer7": "We support all common contract types including: rental leases, employment agreements, freelance/service contracts, subscription agreements, purchase agreements, and more. If you have a specialized contract type, contact us.",
      "faqAnswer8": "Yes! Pro users can download their analysis as a PDF report. Free users can view and share their analysis online but cannot download it.",
      "faqAnswer9": "Pro users can download a revised version of their contract with our recommended changes highlighted. This makes it easy to see what should be negotiated with the other party.",
      "faqAnswer10": "The Free plan includes 1 contract analysis per month, red flag detection, summaries, cost breakdowns, and email support. It's perfect for one-time contract reviews.",
      "faqAnswer11": "Pro gives you unlimited analyses, the ability to download revised contracts and PDFs, an interactive chat assistant, market comparison data, analysis history, and priority support—all for $9.99/month.",
      "faqAnswer12": "Yes! Cancel your subscription at any time with no penalties or hidden fees. You'll retain access until the end of your billing period. We also offer a 30-day money-back guarantee.",
      "faqAnswer13": "Yes. If you're not satisfied within 30 days of purchase, contact us for a full refund, no questions asked.",
      "faqAnswer14": "The Business plan is coming soon! It will include team collaboration features, API access, and dedicated support. Sign up for our newsletter to be notified when it launches.",
      "faqAnswer15": "Your privacy is our priority. We use industry-standard encryption for uploads and storage. Your contracts are never shared with third parties, and you can delete them anytime. We follow GDPR principles for data handling.",
      "faqAnswer16": "Only you can see your contracts. They are never shared with anyone unless you explicitly choose to share a link. Even our support team cannot access your contracts without your permission.",
      "faqAnswer17": "Free users: We keep your last 3 analyses for 30 days. Pro users: Your analyses are stored indefinitely until you delete them. You can configure auto-delete settings in your account to automatically remove old analyses after 30, 60, 90, or 365 days.",
      "faqAnswer18": "Yes. You can delete individual analyses at any time from your Dashboard or MyAnalyses page. You can also export all your data or delete your entire account from the Account Settings page.",
      "faqAnswer19": "Never. We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data or contracts with anyone. Your information is used solely to provide our service to you.",
      "faqAnswer20": "No, ContractGuard provides educational analysis to help you understand your contract. This is not legal advice. For legally binding decisions or complex legal situations, always consult a licensed attorney.",
      "faqAnswer21": "Our analysis is informational and educational. While it can help you understand contract terms, it should not be used as evidence in legal proceedings. Always consult with a qualified attorney for legal matters.",
      "faqAnswer22": "No. ContractGuard is a technology company providing contract analysis tools. We are not a law firm and do not provide legal advice. Our platform is designed to help you understand contracts, but professional legal counsel is recommended for important decisions.",
      "faqAnswer23": "While we strive for accuracy, our system may occasionally miss details or make errors. If you find a mistake, please report it through our Contact page. This helps us improve. Always verify important details with your own review or a legal professional.",
      "faqAnswer24": "Common reasons: file is too large (max 10MB), unsupported format (we accept PDF, JPG, PNG), or poor image quality. Try compressing your file, converting to a supported format, or taking a clearer photo.",
      "faqAnswer25": "Most analyses complete in 60 seconds. If it's taking longer, your contract may be very large or complex. Wait a few more minutes. If it still doesn't complete, refresh the page and try again, or contact support.",
      "faqAnswer26": "Make sure you're using the correct email address. Check your spam folder for the login email. If you still can't log in, use the 'Forgot Password' option or contact our support team.",
      "faqAnswer27": "This can happen if the contract image is unclear, has poor lighting, or the text is too small. Try uploading a higher quality scan or photo. If the problem persists, contact support with your contract ID.",
      "faqAnswer28": "Use our Contact page and select 'Bug Report' as the subject. Include details about what you were doing when the bug occurred, your browser/device, and if possible, a screenshot. We'll investigate and respond quickly."

Se trovi un errore, segnalalo tramite la nostra pagina Contattaci. Questo ci aiuta a migliorare. Verifica sempre i dettagli importanti con la tua revisione o un professionista legale.",
      "faqAnswer24": "Motivi comuni: il file è troppo grande (max 10MB), formato non supportato (accettiamo PDF, JPG, PNG) o scarsa qualità dell'immagine. Prova a comprimere il tuo file, a convertirlo in un formato supportato o a scattare una foto più chiara.",
      "faqAnswer25": "La maggior parte delle analisi si completa in 60 secondi. Se sta impiegando più tempo, il tuo contratto potrebbe essere molto grande o complesso. Attendi qualche minuto in più. Se ancora non si completa, aggiorna la pagina e riprova, oppure contatta il supporto.",
      "faqAnswer26": "Assicurati di utilizzare l'indirizzo email corretto. Controlla la cartella spam per l'email di accesso. Se ancora non riesci ad accedere, utilizza l'opzione 'Password Dimenticata' o contatta il nostro team di supporto.",
      "faqAnswer27": "Questo può accadere se l'immagine del contratto non è chiara, ha scarsa illuminazione o il testo è troppo piccolo. Prova a caricare una scansione o una foto di qualità superiore. Se il problema persiste, contatta il supporto con il tuo ID contratto.",
      "faqAnswer28": "Utilizza la nostra pagina Contattaci e seleziona 'Segnalazione Bug' come oggetto. Includi dettagli su cosa stavi facendo quando si è verificato il bug, il tuo browser/dispositivo e, se possibile, uno screenshot. Indagheremo e risponderemo rapidamente."
